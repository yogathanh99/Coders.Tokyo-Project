    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team1 = players.slice()
    team1[3] = 'Good'

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    temp2[3] = 'Thanh'
    console.log(players,
      temp2) //Use ES6 -> Not Reference -> It create new array from old array but it doesn't use deep copy

    //Or use Array method of ES5 to create new array from original array
    const team3 = Array.from(players)
    team3[3] = 'Trung'
    console.log(players, team3)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //original copy -> Reference
    /*     const ob1 = person
        ob1.number = 11
        console.log(person, ob1) */

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //Use Method Object.assgin of Javasript

      ...person
    }
    ob3.number = 33
